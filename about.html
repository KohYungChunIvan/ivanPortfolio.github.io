        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>I am a second-year Information Technology student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, specializing in Software Engineering with a focus on Web and Mobile Application Development.

            Passionate about creating scalable and user-friendly solutions, I continuously refine my skills to stay at the forefront of modern technology trends.
            
            Driven by a problem-solving mindset, I thrive on tackling technical challenges—whether optimizing system performance, debugging complex code, or exploring innovative software solutions.
        </p>
        <p>Beyond academics, I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and enhancing my understanding of network security and enterprise systems.
            
            I am eager to apply my expertise in software development, networking, and cybersecurity to real-world projects, where I can innovate, collaborate, and grow as a developer.</p>
